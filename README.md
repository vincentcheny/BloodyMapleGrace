## Introduction

This project is intended to host various AHK scripts that Mornrain writes in reply to Maple's feature requests. The aim of these scripts is to facilitate Maple's user experience on Windows OS, and hopefully boost productivity. Mornrain may benefit from this project after sharpening his AHK script writing skill and gaining massive enhancement on capability of searching for tech solutions.

The project's name originates from Maple, whose Chinese name consists of 枫, a quite poetic character that translates to English word "Maple". He is prefixed "Bloody" for conceptually "enslaving" Mornrain to endless script writing job. He is also a cross-dressing lover, henceforward the project name also is a reference and a tribute to *Bloody Mary*, an inspiring female antagonist and horror movie subcultural icon.

Mornrain and Maple are at present studying as BSc. in Computer Science in CUHK, Hong Kong. Interested recruit teams are free to contact.

## How to use

Basically, just install (or extract, in case you don't have the permission to install) [AHK program](https://autohotkey.com) and then run scripts via it.

Besides, if you prefer compilation to interpretation, for portability or alike reasons, you can compile scripts with the compiler shipped with AHK program. Cascade scripts as you like and compile them into one portable executable file.

## Features

1. Automatically readjust text format of chatting record copied from WeChat client, making it easier to save in note-taking software or alike.

2. Add more functionalities to enhance and exploit `Capslock` key, who occupies position of strategic significance.

   - `Capslock` is replaced by `Backspace`, since `Backspace` is used with much more frequency but located in faraway. The rationale is to be justified by the observation that `Capslock` is entirely replaceable by `Shift` but occupies good position.

   - Now you don't need to move fingers from home row to touch direction keys and hence save much effort, as "**context switch is expensive**".

3. [*Currently under heavy debugging and unstable*] Enhancement to num keys. Long pressing num keys send `Fn` keys instead, while short pressing is preserved. This feature is especially practical for using keyboard that doesn't have `Fn` keys, like [`HHKB`](http://www.pfu.com.cn/HHKB/).

4. Detect if a file is currently occupied by another process.

5. Detect if a window is pop up.

6. Switch among virtual desktops via sliding on taskbar.

7. Register default open program for individual files.

## Limitation & Warning

- Due to WeChat client's restriction, script can't handle the unlikely situation where conversation engagers' name is non-trivial, or when conversation contains like-structured sub-conversation, such as storytelling, ~~which sounds like what Maple occasionally does~~.
- The `Fn` script poses limitation that......[to be filled by Mornrain]
